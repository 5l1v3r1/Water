# Water



## What is it ?
Water is a framework of my batchs scripts. 
it is basically made for basic pentesting information but i will add some built-in features to learn how to make some basic scripts.
this file isn't pure batch. it's made with:
```
-> powershell
-> visual basic script
-> and more later
```

### what can i do with it ?
```
-> See your ip address lively
-> get information about a remote IP
-> Scan your network's hosts
```

### what's next ?
```
-> Powershell exploits generator (shell, remote ssh access and more).
-> Listener.
-> Basic batch mess.
-> python features.
```
